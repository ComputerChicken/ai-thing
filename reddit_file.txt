The White House is moving forward with a "TrumpRX" website to sell medicine at lower prices, following an agreement with Pfizer. What are your thoughts? ||| The grift keeps on grifting. ### US Veterans of Reddit, in particular those who have interacted with or worked in proximity to the upper echelons of command, what do you think the sentiment is among the top military staff who were present at today's gathering for the speeches by Sec. Hegseth and President Trump? ||| I couldn't stop chuckling about the fact that The Brass were finally forced into a 2-hour, worthless All Call after doing it to the troops for years. ### What's your take on Hegseth telling US generals/admirals to prepare for war and also calling out those who are fat? ||| If they invade Canada we're going to douse him in the maple syrup and bird seed and let loose all of the Canada geese ### Who is the most evil person in history to get away scot free for their crimes? ||| Idi Amin spent the rest of his life living in luxury in Saudi Arabia.  At least Pol Pot spent the rest of his life moldering in a jungle. ### What’s a subtle sign that someone is mentally unstable? ||| Constantly Needing to assert dominance over people in some way. It's often a sign of childhood neglect or bullying ### Men in the military who have served along side women, how do you feel about the leadership leaning toward no longer having women serve if they cannot meet the 'male testing'? ||| Several years ago the army revamped its PT test from the army physical fitness test (APFT) to the Army combat fitness test (ACFT). During the development process it went through several iterations to land on the right way to grade it. 

The original idea was it would have “gender neutral job based performance requirements”. This meant there was one grading scale with jobs and ranks being put into different classes (heavy, medium, light) based on the physical requirements of that job. This meant combat arms jobs like infantry and armor had higher standards than support jobs like communications and supply. As you were promoted you could also move down in categories. For example as an armor captain I would have been in the “heavy” category with the highest standards because I was leading on the line in a combat arms command. But, when I promoted to Major I would have been moved down to the “medium” category because I would have been in a staff role and no longer expected to actively be leading troops in combat.

Ultimately this plan was shelved because of the optics of excluding females from combat arms because so few of them were passing the heavy requirements. The Army changed to a gender and age system where there are two different sets of standards (one male, one female) and it is a sliding scale based on your age. This makes the physical standards you’re held to completely arbitrary and not tied to the physical requirements of your job. 

This new policy is to go back to having combat arms roles under a gender neutral grading system that holds combat arms jobs to a higher standard. I understand that this may seem discriminatory, but ultimately combat arms jobs should be held to a higher physical standard because it literally means life or death for those involved. This will keep a lot of women out of these roles, but it will also keep a lot of men out of them as well. Being an infantryman, scout, tanker, combat engineer etc is not a right. It’s something that should be withheld to those who can meet the harsh requirements.

I have served with a lot of women who can meet these standards, and I have served with a lot of men who can’t. I would take the ranger tabbed chick who can keep up over the scrawny guy who falls out of a ruck any day. It’s not about what gender you are, it’s about if you can keep up and do the tough physical job. Having gender neutral requirements for combat arms roles means that you know the people who are there with you are the ones who can meet the demanding physical requirements of the job. ### What’s the most overrated city in the world? ||| Vegas.

For years, the only thing that made Vegas bearable was that it was cheap.

For the current price point, there are much better options. ### What is the sexiest random encounter you’ve had with a complete stranger? ||| In college there was a woman who would make out with me every time I saw her. 

I never got her name, but we met at a halloween party and ended up making out, before splitting off. Then we saw each other at a bar a few weeks later and ended up making out before splitting off. 

Then a few months later we ran into each other at a party and ended up making out. 

We'd see each other from across the room, both would smile and then at some point we'd start kissing before she would be like "Cool! thanks, see you later!" 

It was fairly tame compared to some stories, but the randomness of this woman deciding that I was her drunk makeout partner always made me smile. ### USA military members - what did you think of Hegseth & Trump's speeches today? ||| In the words of my generation: this could have been an email. ### What's actually healthy despite most people thinking it's not? ||| Salt and Fat are essential nutrients, meaning you will die without them.

It usually doesn’t last all that long. Once basic services like transportation are affected and like, senators can’t fly home for their weekly vacations things get working again. 
Of course things could be different this time, for obvious reasons. ### What’s a sign you’re officially getting old? ||| You look forward to getting socks at Christmas time instead of dreading them. ### What's a scam that most people still fall for? ||| My cat wanting 2 dinners. ### What is devastating as a teenager but great as an adult? ||| I would love a "go to your room and stay there!" ### What’s a ‘childhood rule’ your parents made up that you later realized was complete nonsense? ||| "You can't swear until you have a driver's license."

A knee-jerk reaction to "how come you can say [word] but I can't." Made enough sense to me. ### What do you think of Trump's threat to cut off federal funds to NYC if the people elect Zohran Mandani? ||| Remember that time when Trump went 72 hours without saying or doing anything illegal and we all thought he passed away? ### What did you want to be growing up? and what are you now? ||| I wanted to be a cat.

(I was not a smart child)

I still want to be a cat (not a very smart adult either) but that's not really working out and I have to pay rent so instead I do data entry for pharmacies. ### What is the worst tactical blunder a military general has ever committed in history? ||| The Battle of Karansebes

In 1788 the Hapsburgs launched a campaign into Romania, which was then under control of the Ottoman turks, and made camp near Karansebes. During the night a hussar cavalry unit had gone out to scout for enemies, on the way they would meet some locals who offered them liquor, of course the hussars accepted. 

Some hours later a separate infantry unit would go out scouting and met the hussars, who were very drunk. The infantry asked the hussars for some of the liquor, the hussars refused. The infantry and hussars kept arguing, until suddenly a soldier from the infantry shouted “Turks! The Turks are here!” With the goal of scaring the hussars. Both the hussars and infantry started panicking, and during the panic a random infantry soldier accidentally fired a shot.

The hussars somehow came to the conclusion that the men they were arguing with were in fact Turkish soldiers disguised as friendly soldiers, and started charging towards and attacking the infantry. The infantry would started running back towards camp screaming, with the hussars close by. 

Meanwhile an artillery commander back at camp, who had woken up upon hearing a gunshot in the distance, went outside to check, only to see a mass of soldiers charging toward the camp, thinking they were Turks, the commander woke up the rest of the camp and ordered cannon fire on the approaching soldiers, while the entire rest of the Hapsburg army hastily fled to escape from the enemy.

Two days later the Turkish army arrived, taking the strategically important Karansebes valley and finding between 1000-10,000 dead Hapsburg troops. The battle is widely regarded as “the worst friendly-fire incident in history”. ### What Happens to ICE Agents in a Federal Shut Down? ||| They are likely considered “mission critical” and will work without pay now but get back pay later.

Baby was 10 months old and he had never once held her because "that's your job". ### What do you wish were easier to do? ||| Make money ### What has been your life altering experience? ||| Fathered a child out of wedlock with a woman I hardly knew who lived in another state 1000 miles away. Took full responsibility for the child and the situation. 100% changed my life for the better BUT it was very difficult/challenging for me and everyone involved including my immediate family.

The ability to "fix" anything by point at what needs to be fixed, and simply stating "Fix this." The context of what "fix" can mean here is both ridiculous, but extremely powerful.


Need to fix a clogged pipe? "Fix this." Clog gone. Need to stop a villian from taking over the world? "Fix this." The villian's trauma and Psychopathy is gone now! No longer wants to take over the world! ### What is your most common thought? ||| Food ### What’s something you refuse to buy the cheap version of? ||| I'm 75

I made sure no news sites are on my browser starting/home pages and moved my news apps to a folder that I have to swipe twice from my home screen to access. 

I realized how often I reflexively tap on the news, so I moved it somewhere where I have to consciously decide to open it.

Edit: Also on Reddit and other social media I have muted a ton of accounts. ### Whats the weirdest thing that turns you on? ||| I have not so much kinks themselves  but a "people who have kinks" kink.

It was honestly super uncomfortable and made me question how someone so... unstable could be in charge of making decisions that affect all of us. Kinda made me realize how important emotional intelligence is in leadership, and how its absence can seriously mess with team morale. ### What are some things that happened as an adult that made you go "Mom/Dad was right."? ||| Relationships & Friends

I saw a video yesterday where 2 guys working at an airport were trying to flip cones in the air and have them land stacked on some cones in-between them.

There were a couple failed attempts but then they both got one and they jumped up and cheered and hugged and it was so cute!! ### What invention do you think completely changed human behavior, but people dont acknowledge enough? ||| Single serve coffee pods. 

Coffee used to be a group activity in a sense, if you were the first person in the office you would brew a nice large pot so everyone that came in after could grab an easy cup of joe and enjoy their morning. If the coffee was brewed exceptionally well, word would travel, questions would be asked "who made the coffee this morning, it's fantastic"

Enter the single serve pod, and suddenly no one shares in the excitement of coffee anymore. You brew a cup for yourself, sure it might taste good, but there's no art to it. Jeff from accounting isn't going to praise it, cause he's not drinking it. It's just another individual task to tackle at the start of the workday.

Sure, the coffee is still there, but the culture is gone. ### Which job is way harder than people think? ||| Someone said to me whilst I was working in a nursing home "so you just sit around and drink tea with old people?"

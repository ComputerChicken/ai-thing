cannot meet the male testing ||| Several years ago the army revamped its PT test from the army physical fitness test APFT to the Army combat fitness test ACFT During the development process it went through several iterations to land on the right way to grade it The original idea was it would have gender neutral job based performance requirements This meant there was one grading scale with jobs and ranks being put into different classes heavy medium light based on the physical requirements of that job This meant combat arms jobs like infantry and armor had higher standards than support jobs like communications and supply As you were promoted you could also move down in categories For example as an armor captain I would have been in the heavy category with the highest standards because I was leading on the line in a combat arms command But when I promoted to Major I would have been moved down to the medium category because I would have been in a staff role and no longer expected to actively be leading troops in combatUltimately this plan was shelved because of the optics of excluding females from combat arms because so few of them were passing the heavy requirements The Army changed to a gender and age system where there are two different sets of standards one male one female and it is a sliding scale based on your age This makes the physical standards youre held to completely arbitrary and not tied to the physical requirements of your job This new policy is to go back to having combat arms roles under a gender neutral grading system that holds combat arms jobs to a higher standard I understand that this may seem discriminatory but ultimately combat arms jobs should be held to a higher physical standard because it literally means life or death for those involved This will keep a lot of women out of these roles but it will also keep a lot of men out of them as well Being an infantryman scout tanker combat engineer etc is not a right Its something that should be withheld to those who can meet the harsh requirementsI have served with a lot of women who can meet these standards and I have served with a lot of men who cant I would take the ranger tabbed chick who can keep up over the scrawny guy who falls out of a ruck any day Its not about what gender you are its about if you can keep up and do the tough physical job Having gender neutral requirements for combat arms roles means that you know the people who are there with you are the ones who can meet the demanding physical requirements of the job ### Whats the most overrated city in

course the hussars accepted Some hours later a separate infantry unit would go out scouting and met the hussars who were very drunk The infantry asked the hussars for some of the liquor the hussars refused The infantry and hussars kept arguing until suddenly a soldier from the infantry shouted Turks The Turks are here With the goal of scaring the hussars Both the hussars and infantry started panicking and during the panic a random infantry soldier accidentally fired a shotThe hussars somehow came to the conclusion that the men they were arguing with were in fact Turkish soldiers disguised as friendly soldiers and started charging towards and attacking the infantry The infantry would started running back towards camp screaming with the hussars close by Meanwhile an artillery commander back at camp who had woken up upon hearing a gunshot in the distance went outside to check only to see a mass of soldiers charging toward the camp thinking they were Turks the commander woke up the rest of the camp and ordered cannon fire on the approaching soldiers while the entire rest of the Hapsburg army hastily fled to escape from the enemyTwo days later the Turkish army arrived taking the
